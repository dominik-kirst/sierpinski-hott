This theorem addresses the first of Hilbert's famous list of unsolved problems in mathematics. I have mechanized this work [8] using Isabelle/ZF [5,6]. Obviously, the theorem's significance makes it a tempting challenge; the proof also has numerous interesting features. It is not a single formal assertion, as most theorems are. G\"{o}del [3, p. 33] states it as follows, using Σto denote the axioms for set theory:What we shall prove is that, if a contradiction from the axiom of choice and the generalized continuum hypothesis were derived in Σ, it could be transformed into a contradiction obtained from the axioms of Σalone.G\"{o}del presents no other statement of this theorem. Neither does he introduce a theory of syntax suitable for reasoning about transformations on proofs, surely because he considers it to be unnecessary}, booktitle = {Proceedings of the 4th Conference on Computability in Europe}, pages = {486–490}, numpages = {5},, series = {CiE '08} }

	abstract = {The original motivation1 for the work described in this paper was to determine the proof theoretic strength of the type theories implemented in the proof development systems Lego and Coq, [12],[4]. These type theories combine the impredicative type of propositions2, from the calculus of constructions, [5], with the inductive types and hierarchy of type universes of Martin-Löf’s constructive type theory, [13]. Intuitively there is an easy way to determine an upper bound on the proof theoretic strength. This is to use the ‘obvious’ types-as-sets interpretation of these type theories in a strong enough classical axiomatic set theory. The elementary forms of type of Martin-Löf’s type theory have their familiar set theoretic interpretation, the impredicative type of propositions can be interpreted as a two element set and the hierarchy of type universes can be interpreted using a corresponding hierarchy of strongly inaccessible cardinal numbers. The assumption of the existence of these cardinal numbers goes beyond the proof theoretic strength of ZFC. But Martin-Löf’s type theory, even with its W types and its hierarchy of universes, is not fully impredicative and has proof theoretic strength way below that of second order arithmetic. So it is not clear that the strongly inaccessible cardinals used in our upper bound are really needed. Of course the impredicative type of propositions does give a fully impredicative type theory, which certainly pushes up the proof theoretic strength to a set theory3, Z−, whose strength is well above that of second order arithmetic. The hierarchy of type universes will clearly lead to some further strengthening. But is it necessary to go beyond ZFC to get an upper bound?},

However, all of the major implementations lack powerful extensionality principles for reasoning about equality, such as function and propositional extensionality. These principles are typically added axiomatically which disrupts the constructive properties of these systems. Cubical type theory provides a solution by giving computational meaning to Homotopy Type Theory and Univalent Foundations, in particular to the univalence axiom and higher inductive types. This paper describes an extension of the dependently typed functional programming language Agda with cubical primitives, making it into a full-blown proof assistant with native support for univalence and a general schema of higher inductive types. These new primitives make function and propositional extensionality as well as quotient types directly definable with computational content. Additionally, thanks also to copatterns, bisimilarity is equivalent to equality for coinductive types. This extends Agda with support for a wide range of extensionality principles, without sacrificing type checking and constructivity.}, journal = {Proc. ACM Program.

	abstract = {This paper studies forcing translations of proofs in dependent type theory, through the Curry-Howard correspondence. Based on a call-by-push-value decomposition, we synthesize two simply-typed translations: i) one call-by-value, corresponding to the translation derived from the presheaf construction as studied in a previous paper; ii) one call-by-name, whose intuitions already appear in Krivine and Miquel's work. Focusing on the call-by-name translation, we adapt it to the dependent case and prove that it is compatible with the definitional equality of our system, thus avoiding coherence problems. This allows us to use any category as forcing conditions, which is out of reach with the call-by-value translation. Our construction also exploits the notion of storage operators in order to interpret dependent elimination for inductive types. This is a novel example of a dependent theory with side-effects, clarifying how dependent elimination for inductive types must be restricted in a non-pure setting. Being implemented as a Coq plugin, this work gives the possibility to formalize easily consistency results, for instance the consistency of the negation of Voevodsky's univalence axiom.},
